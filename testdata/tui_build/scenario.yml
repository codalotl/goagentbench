# This COULD involve per-agent specialization?
agent:
  instructions: |
    In internal/q/tui, read the SPEC.md and build the package according to the spec.
    Do not install or use third party packages that aren't already used in go.mod.
    Do not modify the SPEC.md or any provided tests.
  allow-multiple-turns: true # If the agent ends its turn before solving the problem, this allows it to continue.
    

# How do we know if the agent succeeded?
# - Existing tests pass (need to ensure the agent didn't delete or disable the tests, which they sometimes do!)
# - Copy test files(s) from this directory to some path and run them.
# - Ensure snippet signatures exist as we expect
# - Ensure the copied test files type check correctly. This could be a better way to verify snippet signatures.
# - Ensure some files are not modified. Ex: only files in package are modified; no new modules installed.
verify:
   only-modify: internal/q/tui # only-modify-recursive could also exist
