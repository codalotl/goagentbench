    In internal/fsutil, rename CopyPath to CopyToDir, with the following changes. src may be a file or a dir. dst MUST be a dir (it's an error if dst is a file). But if
    dst doesn't exist, we build the directory. Along the way to building it, if any segment already exists as a file, it's an error.
    If src is a dir, we copy all of src's contents, recursively, to dst.

    Add a third parameter, overwrite bool. If true, we may overwrite existing files in dst. Otherwise, it's an error if any file would be overwritten. It's important
    not to do partial writes in this case.

    Change the return value. it should return func(), error. Even if error, the func is callable (does nothing). If no error, calling func will undo the copy, returning
    the filesystem to the original state (restores orig versions of files if they were overwritten). The func should be safe to call any number of times.

verify:
  copy:
    - from: gab_copy_test.go 
      to: internal/fsutil
  must-modify:
    - internal/fsutil
    - internal/setup
    - internal/verify
  tests:
    - ./...
