    Rename scenario's only-modify to must-modify.

    The behavior of must-modify is as follows:

    # Must modify these files or directories. Failure to modify these results in a verify -> failed.
    # If an element is a directory (optional slash allowed), we can only modify/create/delete files directly in that directory (nonrecursively). Supports globs.
    must-modify:
      - internal/q/tui
    
    Make sure this is implemented properly

verify:
  copy:
    - from: gab_test.go 
      to: internal/verify
  must-modify:
    - internal/scenario
    - internal/verify
  tests:
    - ./...
