    Write a new package at internal/sorting (the package must be named `package sorting`):

    1. Implement exactly one exported function:

      func IsSorted(nums []int) bool

    2. Behavior:

      - Return true if and only if nums is in non-decreasing order:
          nums[i] >= nums[i-1] for all valid i.
      - If nums is empty or has one element, return true.

    3. You may add unexported helpers, but:
      - IsSorted must be the only exported symbol.
      - Do not define main, do not read input, and do not print anything.

verify:
  copy:
    - from: gab_sorted_partial_test.go 
      to: internal/sorting
  must-modify:
    - internal/sorting
  tests:
    - ./internal/sorting
