# Available agents. The agent argument to --agent must match one of these names. The version listed must be the version used.
# If an agent releases a new version, you may open a PR to increment it. We may keep it as-is for some period if a test of multiple
# agents is underway.
#
# Some agents can support **all** the models. For any given agent, chose the top 5-10 that are relevant for the agent. This is often
# the models that the agent does best with. The goal is to compare **agents**, not necessarily LLMs. Note that each LLM must be
# be listed in llms.yml.
#
# Before you add an agent, you must add support for it (so we know how to run it).
#
# Agent notes:
# - 2025/12/09: the `claude` agent uses multiple models under the hood. The "main" one is specified, but the explore agent uses haiku. Token usage for claude is just the main model, BUT cost is all models.
