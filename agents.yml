# Available agents. The agent argument to --agent must match one of these names. The version listed must be the version used.
# If an agent releases a new version, you may open a PR to increment it. We may keep it as-is for some period if a test of multiple
# agents is underway.
#
# Some agents can support **all** the models. For any given agent, chose the top 5-10 that are relevant for the agent. This is often
# the models that the agent does best with. The goal is to compare **agents**, not necessarily LLMs. Note that each LLM must be
# be listed in llms.yml.
#
# Before you add an agent, you must add support for it (so we know how to run it).
