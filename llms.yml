# llms is the LLMs we support. Note that this is not **providers**. Routers like OpenRouter are irrelevant here (unless they ship a custom model).
# For models like gpt-5 which support reasoning levels, each configuration should be listed as a separate model.
# Only list **the best** models per LLM provider, and within those, only the best configurations.
# Note that "the best" does not necessarily mean smartest - there can be a few different categories of "best" (fast vs smart).
#
# The 'name' field is referred to by agents.yml and by the --model CLI flag. The 'model' is what is sent to the actual agent.
# If two agents can use the same conceptual model, but refer to them differently (ex: 'claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking' vs 'claude-opus-4-5' might be the same), then
# we can add a 'per-agent' field to the llm object with per-agent override.
#
# For Claude models, reasoning-level: high -> "extended thinking" (10kMAX_THINKING_TOKENS=4096 tokens if we need to set it manually).
