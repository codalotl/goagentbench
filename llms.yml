# llms is the LLMs we support. Note that this is not **providers**. Routers like OpenRouter are irrelevant here (unless they ship a custom model).
# For models like gpt-5 which support reasoning levels, each configuration should be listed as a separate model.
# Only list **the best** models per LLM provider, and within those, only the best configurations.
# Note that "the best" does not necessarily mean smartest - there can be a few different categories of "best" (fast vs smart).
